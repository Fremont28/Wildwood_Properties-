Analyzing Wildwood's hot real estate market 

Wildwood New Jersey is best known as a popular family vacation spot located on the southern tip of the Jersey Shore. It features quirky motels and old school diners with a 1960s and 70s look and a boardwalk complete with roller coasters and pretty much every junk food imaginable.

Today, real estate buyers are flocking to Wildwood. According to Zillow, a real estate website, the median home value here is $231,000 and has gone up by 4.7% over the last year. Based on Wildwood’s hot market, it is definitely worth examining buying trends and which areas have the most value here.

Selling a property faster is usually the goal of the realtor and home owner. In Wildwood, homes and rentals that sell in the first two months typically net the most profit. 

We find that Wildwood listings that listings that sell within the first 66 days receive lost just $5,000 between the ask price and sold price. Properties that stay longer on the market (>66 days) force sellers to take $9,000 less than the ask price.

The majority of listings in Wildwood are clustered in North Wildwood and Wildwood proper with a scattering of West Wildwood properties (~5.1%). Nearly 35% of all listings were sold in April, May, and June. Buyers were least likely to purchase properties in July and January.

Slightly over 50% of the listings were asking between $169,000 and $365,000 with around 25% falling above and below these latter and former marks respectively. The most popular rentals sold are located on 500 Kennedy Drive (23 condos, 1 townhouse), 225 East Wildwood Avenue (16 condos), and 1800 Ocean Avenue (14 condos).
